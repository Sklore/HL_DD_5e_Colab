Haughty and arrogant, sun elves typically feel themselves superior to most other races, including other Tel-quessir.\n\nPhysical characteristics\nLike all of the Tel-quessir, the sun elves are close to the height of humans, but with notable differences. Sun elves have bronze-colored skin and hair most often of copper, golden blond, and black, with red more uncommon but not unheard of. Sun elves, like other eladrin, typically have green eyes, though golden ones are also common, often with a liquid appearance, and silver, black, hazel, or copper hues have also been heard of. Like their moon elven brethren, male sun elves are typically taller and heavier than females, sometimes by as much as five inches or twenty pounds.\n\nSun elves have a reputation for being stronger but less durable than other eladrin.

They survive in the Underdark by maintaining wariness of others and working hard to keep their underground society secret.\n\nPhysical description\nDeep gnomes are wiry and lean with a body as hard as a slab of rock. Males are completely bald and beardless, while the females sport hair. Ranging from 3&apos; to 3&apos;6&quot; (107 cm) in height and weighing between 40 and 45 lbs (20.4 kg), the deep gnomes are small enough to give them a size advantage when battling larger opponents. Deep gnome complexions are sometimes described as &quot;gnarled&quot; and, like drow and duergar, are commonly dark in hue, with most deep gnomes demonstrating brown or gray skin, with dark gray eyes, as well as gray hair if female. Deep gnomes do not live quite as long as their kin, with a life expectancy just under two centuries. Due to this and a number of cultural affectations, deep gnome children are considered adults at roughly twenty years of age.\n\nAbilities\nDeep gnome are better adapted for underground living than either rock gnomes or forest gnomes, with darkvision to help them see where there is no light. Similarly, deep gnomes have a dwarven-like affinity for stone and innately understand it on a level few other races can appreciate. Deep gnomes also lack most gnomes&apos; predilection for cantrip like abilities but can instead blind other beings, obscure their own presence, or shapeshift. Deep gnomes also have a great deal of resistance to magic of any kind, and can go undetected as if they were using the nondetection spell, alongside their natural affinity for avoiding danger or hiding.\n\nDeep Gnome Feat\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, your deep gnome character has the option of taking the Svirfneblin Magic feat." compset="SubRace" summary="Deep gnomes, called svirfneblin in their own language, are a gnome subrace that live in the Underdark." uniqueness="unique">
