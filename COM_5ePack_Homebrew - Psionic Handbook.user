  <thing id="s5CDisAstr" name="Astral Manipulation" description="Through this discipline, you deliver messages, travel, and even avoid death by manipulating the Astral Plane.\n\n{b}Psychic Focus.{/b} While focused on this discipline, you can use your reaction when you are hit by an attack to slip partially into the Astral Plane for a moment. Nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from the attack is reduced by 3.\n\n{b}* Dream (7).{/b} By spending 1 minute in uninterrupted meditation, you cast the dream spell. Duration: 8 hours. This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.\n\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.\n\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage. If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.\n\n{b}* Astral Seed (11).{/b} By spending 8 hours in uninterrupted meditation, you weave strands of astral ectoplasm and diamond dust worth at least 1,000 gp into a crystal containing the seed of your living mind. The crystal remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as it remains undisturbed. At any time thereafter, if you die, your soul transfers to the crystal, provided that your soul is free and you are willing to return, and your physical remains become inert and can’t thereafter be restored to life, since your soul is elsewhere. While your soul resides in the crystal, you can use powers and perform any other purely mental actions. You have thirty days to grow a new organic body, after which time your sentience fades and your soul passes on if it hasn’t entered a new body. To grow a body, you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in uninterrupted solitude. The body’s constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, then slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing body that is physically identical to your original. Optionally, you can also choose to have the new body be a younger version of your own. The crystal itself breaks down and becomes part of the new organic body when the tenth day ends, at which point you completely and totally inhabit the new body. Your new self is identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of your original self’s equipment.\n\n{b}* Astral Projection (13).{/b} By spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation, you cast the astral projection spell. You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.\n\nYour astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut —something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does— your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.\n\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.\n\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation. If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points." compset="Spell" summary="Deliver messages, travel, and even avoid death by manipulating the Astral Plane.">

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named.

The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.\n\nThe information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips.”\n\n{b}* Remote Viewing (7).{/b} After 10 minutes of uninterrupted meditation, you cast the scrying spell.

You can see and hear through the sensor as if it were there. the sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of a fist. Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn&apos;t move.\n\n{b}* Precognition (13).{/b} As an action, you bestow upon yourself a limited ability to see into the immediate future.

One creature that you can see within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for 1 minute. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell or power, this effect ends, and none of the target&apos;s memories are modified. \n\nWhile this charm lasts, you can affect the target&apos;s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event. You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. \n\nIf the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature&apos;s memory isn&apos;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the effect ends. A modified memory doesn&apos;t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature&apos;s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner. \n\nA remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature&apos;s true memory, as does a restore health effect from the psionic restoration discipline. You may spend additional psi points to alter memories further within the creature’s past: 7 days ago (9 psi points total), 30 days ago (10 psi points total), 1 year ago (11 psi points total), or any time in the creature’s past (13 psi points total).\n\n{b}* Enthrall (10).{/b} As an action, you touch an incapacitated humanoid.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. \n\n{b}* Mindkiller (13).{/b} You snuff out the very mind of a foe, slaying it with overwhelming will.

When you use this effect and as your action on each turn until the effect ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn&apos;t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature - what is most on its mind in that moment.\n\nAs an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature&apos;s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature&apos;s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the effect ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature&apos;s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check if it succeeds, the effect ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this effect is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.\n\nYou can also use this effect to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can&apos;t see. When you cast the effect or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can&apos;t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn&apos;t speak any language.

Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the creature must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature  gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.\n\n- Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with blindsight.\n- Blindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even though darkvision does).\n- Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight.\n- Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.\n- Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.\n- Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.\n\n{b}* Tremorsense (1, C).{/b} As a bonus action, you gain tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet for up to 1 minute. A creature with tremorsense is sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground and within range. If no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to those that it’s sensing, then the range defines the maximum distance of the shortest indirect path. It must itself be in contact with the ground, and the creatures must be moving. As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including casting spells with somatic components, they’re considered moving; they don’t have to move from place to place for a creature with tremorsense to detect them. Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense the location of creatures moving through water. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text.\n\n{b}* Unwavering Eye (1, C).{/b} As a bonus action, you gain advantage on Wisdom checks for up to 1 minute.\n\n{b}* Truesight (5, C).{/b} As a bonus action, you gain truesight with a radius of 30 feet for up to 1 minute.
