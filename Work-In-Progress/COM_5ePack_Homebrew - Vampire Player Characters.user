  <thing id="t5CVampire" name="Vampire" description="VAMPIRES ARE AMONG THE most enduringly popular monsters of folklore and mythology. From the ageold tales of the peasantry to the smash hits of Bram Stoker, Anne Rice, and Stephanie Meyers, vampires have captured the imagination as creatures of both revulsion and desire. Numerous video games, books, movies, and TV shows feature vampire protagonists, and so many people want to role-play as vampires that there are entire RPG lines devoted to the subject.\n\nThis document presents rules for playing vampire characters in 5th Edition. BEWARE! Vampire characters are more complicated than ordinary PHB classes and races. Vampires are extremely powerful, but come with a host of equally troublesome weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Usually when a person wishes to play a vampire it’s because they want this level of complexity—they want to struggle against supernatural flaws and exhibit weird powers. But the DM needs to make sure that these drawbacks don’t interfere with the fun had by the other players.\n\nVAMPIRE TEMPLATE\nA player character slain by a vampire’s bite attack may rise the next night as a vampire spawn. They gain all of the features listed in the vampire template on page 4, plus the Enthralled feature: Enthralled. As a vampire spawn, you are charmed by the vampire that killed you (your master). While charmed, you must obey your master’s spoken commands. You remain charmed until your master is destroyed or until you drink your master’s blood.\n\nIf your master orders you to act against your alignment, bonds, or ideals, you may make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your master’s proficiency bonus + your master’s Charisma modifier). On a success, you are no longer charmed.\n\nFORMER VAMPIRES\nA vampire character who is killed and then raised from the dead becomes a living creature again. You lose the vampire template and all of its features. \n\nIf you have levels in the vampire class and are restored to life, you lose all vampire class features except your hit points, hit dice, proficiencies, and proficiency bonus. You retain your level for effects that depend on level. You also retain the Ability Score Improvement and Extra Attack features, if you have them. If you die, you may rise as a vampire at the next sundown, regaining your vampire class features. \n\nEach time you gain a level while alive, you may retroactively convert one of your vampire levels into a level of another class. Replace all the features of the vampire class at your highest class level with the features of the new class at its next\nlevel." compset="Template" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cHelpVam" name="Vampire" description="In a darkened alley, a mysterious black-clad stranger swoops down upon a group of thugs, dispatching them with swift and bloody efficiency.\n\nAn elven warrior patrols her ancient homeland by night, mercilessly slaying intruders, leaving their bodies mangled beyond recognition. They say the recluse who lives in the old tower is some kind of mage—certainly, he has creepy magical abilities. He’ll help those in need… for a price.\n\nVampire have ever been popular monsters because of their humanity. As formerly-living people, who now indulge in their darkest desires, vampires serve as a sort of mirror image of ourselves, behaving in ways that horrify us and tempt us at the same time. Yet this has also made them sympathetic anti-heroes, combining supernatural powers, a virtuous struggle against temptation, and license to let loose in ways we don’t permit ourselves. The scariest thing about vampires isn’t that they might kill you, or that they might turn you into one; it’s the knowledge that some part of you wants to become like them. \n\nVampires in 5th Edition are legendary monsters, but with the right sort of role-playing, they can be heroes as well.\n\nLIVING DEAD\nVampires are not alive—they are undead, as surely as any zombie or ghost. But of all the undead, vampires have the most lifelike appearance, even passing for living humanoids in most circumstances. They exist in a sort of halfstate, embracing both the cold sleep of the grave and the rich warmth of living blood. Vampires lust after life, “living” it to the fullest.\n\nIRRESISTIBLE CHARMS\nVampires have an unnatural allure, an animal agnetism that draws people to them. Beyond the vampire’s charming gaze, their whole being is suffused with a power and a mystery and a potential that compels lesser minds.\n\nDARK HEROES\nBound to the night, suffused with shadow, and under the sway of evil urges, vampires seem unlikely heroes. Yet some withstand the dark temptations of their curse, a supreme act of selfcontrol. These rare vampire heroes—seen as monsters by those they seek to protect—focus their unnatural powers and appetites on the fight against evil.\n\nCREATING A VAMPIRE CHARACTER\nNo one is born a vampire. Who was your character before they were bitten? How old were you—and how many years (or decades, or centuries) ago was it? \n\nSome are bitten by a vampire and left for dead, never really knowing the creature that sired them. Others begin their undeath as vampirespawn, servants of a master vampire, who may treat them as minions, students, playthings, or food supplies. Decide what sort of vampire granted you the gift of eternal life, and how you broke free of this creature’s influence. \n\nFinally, how do you feel about your new existence? Most vampires are unrepentantly evil, reveling in their newfound power and caring only to satisfy their thirst for blood. But those who become adventures often struggle against their dark nature, striving to use their supernatural abilities for good, rather than evil. Some may follow a higher calling, while others seek a way to remove the curse and return to life.\n\nQUICK BUILD\nYou can make a vampire quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma, and then Constitution. Select the half-elf race, applying your ability score bonuses to Dexterity and Constitution, and select the Acrobatics and Perception skills. Select the Noble background. Take your first level in the vampire class, selecting the Deception, Intimidation, and Stealth skills. Select a rapier and a light crossbow as your starting weapons." compset="Class" uniqueness="unique">
