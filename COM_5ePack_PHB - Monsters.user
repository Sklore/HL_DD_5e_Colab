Many variant beholder species exist, such as &quot;observers&quot;, &quot;spectators&quot;, &quot;eyes of the deep&quot;, &quot;elder orbs&quot;, &quot;hive mothers&quot;, and &quot;death tyrants&quot;. In addition, some rare beholders can use their eyes for non-standard spell-like abilities; these mutant beholders are often killed or exiled by their peers. Beholders wishing to cast spells like ordinary wizards relinquish the traditional use of their eyestalks, and put out their central anti-magic eye, making these beholder mages immediate outcasts.\n\n10,000 XP\nA beholder encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP)." compset="Race">
