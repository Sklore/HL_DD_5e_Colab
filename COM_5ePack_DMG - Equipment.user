In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expend in a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic component Once used, this property of the tome can&apos;t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nWhile attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book&apos;s cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.\n\nVecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="mw5CDMGMoo" name="Moonblade" description="{i}Weapon (longs word), legendary (requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment){/i}\n\nOf all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a {i}moonblade{/i}. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain. \n\nA {i}moonblade{/i} passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power. \n\nA moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.\n\nA {i}moonblade{/i} won&apos;t serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make abil ity checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.\n\nA {i}moonblade{/i} has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the {i}Moonblade Properties Table{/i}.\n\n{i}{b}MOONBLADE PROPERTIES{/b}\nd100 - Property\n01-40 - Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade already has a +3 bonus. \n41-80 - The moonblade gai ns a randomly determined minor property (see &quot;Special Fe atures&quot; earlier in this chapter).\n81-82 - The moonblade gains the finesse property.\n83-84 - The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet).\n85-86 - The moonblade functions as a defender.\n87-90 - The moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.\n91-92 - When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack an extra 1d6 slashing damage.\n93-94 - When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon , fiend , or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid , cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. 95-96 You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns , ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can&apos;t be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.\n97-98 - The moonblade fun ctions as a ring of spell storing. \n99 - You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don&apos;t already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it is neutral , immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn&apos;t create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action .\n00 - The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.{/i}\n\nSentience. A {i}moonblade{/i} is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. \n\nThe weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder&apos;s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. \n\n{b}Personality{/b}. Every {i}moonblade{/i} seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose. The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute. \n\nIf a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals." compset="MagicWep">

If you score a critical hit with it, the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its hit point maximum. \n\nThe weapon also functions as a {i}trident of fish command{/i} and a {i}weapon of warning{/i}. It can confer the benefit of a {i}cap of water breathing{/i} while you hold it, and you can use it as a cube of force by choosing the effect, instead of pressing cube sides to select it. \n\n{b}Sentience{/b}. {i}Wave{/i} is a sentient weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}. When it grows restless, {i}Wave{/i} has a habit  of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods. \n\n{i}Wave{/i} zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon&apos;s objectives in the world. \n\nThe trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to-or rebellion against-that god. \n\n{i}Wave{/i} harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, {i}Wave{/i} fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god&apos;s demise. This destiny is something {i}Wave{/i} might not be able to avert." compset="MagicWep">

  <thing id="mw5CDMGWhe" name="Whelm" description="{i}Weapon (warhammer), legendary (requires attunement by a dwarf){/i}\n\n{i}Whelm{/i} is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain. \n\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with {i}Whelm{/i}, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.\n\n{b}Thrown Weapon{/b}. {i}Whelm{/i} has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don&apos;t have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.\n\n{b}Shock Wave{/b}. You can use an action to strike the ground with {i}Whelm{/i} and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can&apos;t be used again until the next dawn. \n\n{b}Supernatural Awareness{/b}. While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can&apos;t cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn. \n\n{b}Sentience{/b}. {i}Whelm{/i} is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. \n\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}. Whelm&apos;s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves.\n\nWhelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. \n\nThe hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan." compset="MagicWep">
