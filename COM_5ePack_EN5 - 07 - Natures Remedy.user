Stored correctly by an experienced herbalist in a vial of vinegar, the acorn becomes brittle and hard. Simply swallowing it is enough to recover 1d6 hit points, although doing so is a fairly unpleasant task and requires the  recipient to swallow it whole.\n\nSkill Wisdom (Medicine) 15; preparation time 1 action" compset="Gear">

While it can do little for poison damage already taken, it can help to end or resist a poison in the patient&apos;s system. After imbibing the leaf as part of a soup, the recipient gains advantage on all saving throws made to resist or end the effects of a poison for one hour.
