He is venerated by human, elf, and half-elf, bards.\n\nMilil is the ultimate performer: self-confident, inspired, possessed of total recall or anything he sets a mind to remember, able to improvise facilely out of desire or necessity, well-educated in general theories of conduct and broad areas of knowledge, and masterful in all sorts of performance technique (including a passing knowledge of disguise derived from costume theory), especially within his sphere of knowledge—music, poetry, and elegant speech. However, he is also self-centered and egotistical and likes to be the center of attention. When he is not the center of attention, he bores easily, and his mind wanders or he leaves. He is also given to flirtation with both deities and mortals for his own enjoyment, to deep annoyance of more sober powers.\n\nMilil often manifests as haunting music, particularly in clearing deep in woodlands. He appears as a wordless, lone male voice soaring through the air where no singer can be seen. At times, Milil draws the image of two dancing hollyphants in the air in glowing yellow lines or in ink (that appears from nowhere) on parchment to signify his approval. This seems to indicate his delight in watching such creatures dance to his music. More often, Milil manifests as a radiance surrounding a bard, storyteller, or epic poet in the throes of inspiration—a sight always heralding a performance that moves an audience to tears, blind obedience, enthusiastic offerings of money, or whatever else the performer desires them to do. Milil often places helpful visions (mental pictures of the whereabouts of treasure, lost loved ones, or directions overland) in the mind of a singer or musician who pleases him.\n\nMilil also acts through the appearance or presence of aasimar (all accomplished singers), hollyphants, light aasimons, movanic devas and solars. More commonly he sends songbirds especially nightingales, white horses or pegasi, calico cats, red or yellow roses, lilies, peonies, perfect gemstones of any sort, and peregrine falcons to show his favor and as a sign to inspire his faithful." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

In the years leading to the War of Souls, magic was fading even as Takhisis’ power grew.\n\nAlso during this time, Takhisis searched the world, ensuring she was the only divine power remaining, and was astounded to discover one other power. In her search, she found a slumbering godling, which she awakened in 404 AC and decided to manipulate and make her own tool of vengeance against the world. She sent this young girl to the isle of Schallsea, finding amusement in having the young girl raised by her enemies, before she took the girl, who was named Mina under her wing. In the guise of the One God, Takhisis made Mina her first cleric in the Age of Mortals.\n\nMina would soon take control of the Knights of Neraka (formerly the Knights of Takhisis) and lead an army of the dead in the latest bid to conquer Ansalon. When the gods rediscovered the location of Krynn, they stripped Takhisis of her immortality. Paladine was likewise made a mortal to maintain the Balance. Takhisis was run through by a broken dragonlance, wielded by the elf prince Silvanoshei. Takhisis was buried by Mina in a tomb whose location is unknown. The gods have covered it up and erased all memory of where it might be." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

He festers within the hearts of mortals, trying to get them to give up the shell of mortality and move on to the next stage in the soul’s journey. Chemosh tempts mortals with the promise of “immortality.” In reality, he is condemning them to an eternity of undeath as his slaves. This is Chemosh’s way of mocking life.\n\nChemosh opposes Mishakal, who stands as a champion of life, as well as the rest of the gods of good, and is often also in conflict with Chislev and Sirrion. One of his divine messengers is the Death&apos;s Head Scorpion.\n\nChemosh was brought from Beyond during the time of creation to serve Takhisis. He alone was given the right to sit at the Hall of Soul’s Journeying to witness the passing of the dead. During the Age of Dreams, he gained a major foothold on the realm of Ansalon when he formed the Bone Warriors and the Bone Acolytes, who conquered in his name before eventually being destroyed. The Lord of Death taught Takhisis how to manipulate the souls of dead, a secret which she used for her own personal gain on stealing the world from under the nose of Chemosh and all the other gods during the Summer of Chaos. The spurned god was pleased to see Takhisis and her nemesis Paladine fall at the close of the War of Souls, after the gods returned to the world." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="dei5CZeboi" name="Zeboim" description="Zeboim is goddess of the seas, storms, and strife. Her moods change with the storm, being calm one minute and in a violent rage the next. Zeboim is perhaps the most unpredictable of all the gods. Zeboim is twin to Nuitari, and the daughter of Takhisis and Sargonnas. Of all the gods, she detests Habbakuk the most. She feels that she should have sole domain over the sea, where he has dominion over sea creatures.\n\nZeboim is said to be mother of Ariakan, the son of Ariakas. She raised the isle that Storm&apos;s Keep rests on from the depths to serve as the headquarters of the Knights of Takhisis during the Chaos War. After the Chaos War and her son’s death, she had condemned Ausric Krell to become a death knight, where he would be trapped in Storm’s Keep forever. However in 422 AC, when she encountered the mortal Mina, she gave the girl her blessing to ultimately defeat Krell and aided her. Mina apparently defeated Krell and left Storm&apos;s Keep, however it was only afterwards that Zeboim realised she had been duped and that Krell had not been destroyed and that Mina was a disciple of Chemosh.\n\nRealising the duplicity of Mina, Zeboim then recruited the monk Rhys Mason to track down Mina and to attempt to ruin the plots of Chemosh. The goddess aided Rhys on numerous occasions, before learning that Chemosh contained the soul of her son Ariakan in a khas piece, which had since been given to Ausric Krell, who was located in Storm&apos;s Keep once more. Zeboim swore to free Ariakan from his prison, but was forced to play Chemosh&apos;s game for the time being, supporting him in taking over the dark pantheon.\n\nAt the behest of Zeboim, the kender Nightshade Pricklypear and the former monk Rhys Mason journeyed to Storm&apos;s Keep, where they tricked Ausric Krell and recovered the Ariakan khas piece. The adventurers returned the khas piece to Zeboim, although the goddess raged that she was unable to restore her son to his former form. Chemosh then contacted Zeboim, asking her aid in rescuing Mina from Nuitari, in return for restoring Ariakan&apos;s soul so he could live once more. The goddess sought out the Tower of the Blood Sea, where her twin was holding Mina and threatened to destroy the tower. Nuitari reluctantly released Mina into Zeboim&apos;s care, rather than see his tower destroyed. The goddess took Mina briefly to New Ports, to introduce Mina to her monk Rhys Mason, before returning her to the arms of Chemosh, and getting Ariakan&apos;s soul released. Zeboim then appeared to Mina at Castle Beloved, and gave her a set of black pearls, telling her they would grant her heart&apos;s desire, before vanishing once more.\n\nOn learning that Rhys Mason had forsaken her and returned to worshipping Majere, the goddess appeared in the Shrine of Zeboim and confronted her former monk. She demanded information about Mina and her origins, however Rhys was unable to comply. In punishment, she left him and his companions chained and stranded in her grotto. Zeboim then travelled to a distant temple of Majere, where she faced the god and tried to learn the secret of Mina from him. However Majere offered her nothing and she left in a huff. She would soon learn with her fellow gods that Mina was in truth a god herself. The goddess appeared genuinely upset that harm may befall Mina and even offered to take her beneath the waves and care for her as her own daughter... an offer which all the other gods were certain had ulterior motives. She then swore an oath with her fellow gods to not harm, seduce or try to sway Mina at all, but leave her to her own devices. Zeboim then appeared to Rhys Mason once more, only to learn that Mina was travelling with him, in the guise of a six year old girl. The goddess left in a huff, when Mina wanted nothing to do with her however. Although she later reappeared and told Mina she could use her powers to speed walk to Solace and further her journey, deciding to help the girl once more and showing her affection.\n\nIn 426 AC, Zeboim began plotting with her Mahkwahb followers to acquire all three known Impaling Thrones and flood the world with water." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">
