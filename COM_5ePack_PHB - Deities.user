He is venerated by human, elf, and half-elf, bards.\n\nMilil is the ultimate performer: self-confident, inspired, possessed of total recall or anything he sets a mind to remember, able to improvise facilely out of desire or necessity, well-educated in general theories of conduct and broad areas of knowledge, and masterful in all sorts of performance technique (including a passing knowledge of disguise derived from costume theory), especially within his sphere of knowledge—music, poetry, and elegant speech. However, he is also self-centered and egotistical and likes to be the center of attention. When he is not the center of attention, he bores easily, and his mind wanders or he leaves. He is also given to flirtation with both deities and mortals for his own enjoyment, to deep annoyance of more sober powers.\n\nMilil often manifests as haunting music, particularly in clearing deep in woodlands. He appears as a wordless, lone male voice soaring through the air where no singer can be seen. At times, Milil draws the image of two dancing hollyphants in the air in glowing yellow lines or in ink (that appears from nowhere) on parchment to signify his approval. This seems to indicate his delight in watching such creatures dance to his music. More often, Milil manifests as a radiance surrounding a bard, storyteller, or epic poet in the throes of inspiration—a sight always heralding a performance that moves an audience to tears, blind obedience, enthusiastic offerings of money, or whatever else the performer desires them to do. Milil often places helpful visions (mental pictures of the whereabouts of treasure, lost loved ones, or directions overland) in the mind of a singer or musician who pleases him.\n\nMilil also acts through the appearance or presence of aasimar (all accomplished singers), hollyphants, light aasimons, movanic devas and solars. More commonly he sends songbirds especially nightingales, white horses or pegasi, calico cats, red or yellow roses, lilies, peonies, perfect gemstones of any sort, and peregrine falcons to show his favor and as a sign to inspire his faithful." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="dei5CTakis" name="Takhisis" description="Takhisis was sister to Gilean and Paladine, and was the goddess of control and Evil. Takhisis, along with Paladine, was called from the Beyond to be custodians of the world. She was the head of the Evil gods, consort to Sargonnas, and mother to Zeboim and Nuitari. Takhisis was responsible for the corruption of the chromatic dragons, and appeared in one form as a dragon with heads of blue, black, white, red, and green.\n\nDuring the Third Dragon War, Takhisis attempted to conquer Ansalon. She was defeated when a Knight of the Crown named Huma thrust a Dragonlance into the heart of one of her aspects. Huma exacted a promise from her, sworn by the High God, to leave Krynn and never enter it again. She would renege on that promise during the War of the Lance, when her Chromatic Dragons entered the world again. Ansalon was nearly conquered by her Dragonarmies, led by Ariakas, the self-proclaimed Emperor of Ansalon.\n\nDuring the Chaos War, Takhisis had new followers in the form of the Knights of Takhisis, created by Ariakas’ son, Ariakan. They nearly conquered Ansalon, when the mad god Chaos attacked Krynn. She forced the Gods of Good to withdraw their support from their followers so that her Knights of Takhisis could unify Ansalon and be in a position to fight the mad god. During the final battle with Chaos, Takhisis had supposedly fled to save her own hide. In reality, Takhisis moved Krynn from its place in time and space to a spot in the universe that not even Zivilyn could see.\n\nTakhisis spent nearly 40 years in the early Age of Mortals recuperating from the monumental task of stealing a world. In that time, the Dragon Overlords appeared and conquered Ansalon. Takhisis disguised herself in this time as the Shadow Sorcerer and taught the ways of sorcery to Palin Majere and, in secret, to Dalamar. She encouraged the discovery of Ambient Magic so that she could use the dead to steal its power. In the years leading to the War of Souls, magic was fading even as Takhisis’ power grew.\n\nAlso during this time, Takhisis searched the world, ensuring she was the only divine power remaining, and was astounded to discover one other power. In her search, she found a slumbering godling, which she awakened in 404 AC and decided to manipulate and make her own tool of vengeance against the world. She sent this young girl to the isle of Schallsea, finding amusement in having the young girl raised by her enemies, before she took the girl, who was named Mina under her wing. In the guise of the One God, Takhisis made Mina her first cleric in the Age of Mortals.\n\nMina would soon take control of the Knights of Neraka (formerly the Knights of Takhisis) and lead an army of the dead in the latest bid to conquer Ansalon. When the gods rediscovered the location of Krynn, they stripped Takhisis of her immortality. Paladine was likewise made a mortal to maintain the Balance. Takhisis was run through by a broken dragonlance, wielded by the elf prince Silvanoshei. Takhisis was buried by Mina in a tomb whose location is unknown. The gods have covered it up and erased all memory of where it might be." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

Chemosh tempts mortals with the promise of “immortality.” In reality, he is condemning them to an eternity of undeath as his slaves. This is Chemosh’s way of mocking life.\n\nChemosh opposes Mishakal, who stands as a champion of life, as well as the rest of the gods of good, and is often also in conflict with Chislev and Sirrion. One of his divine messengers is the Death&apos;s Head Scorpion.\n\nChemosh was brought from Beyond during the time of creation to serve Takhisis. He alone was given the right to sit at the Hall of Soul’s Journeying to witness the passing of the dead. During the Age of Dreams, he gained a major foothold on the realm of Ansalon when he formed the Bone Warriors and the Bone Acolytes, who conquered in his name before eventually being destroyed. The Lord of Death taught Takhisis how to manipulate the souls of dead, a secret which she used for her own personal gain on stealing the world from under the nose of Chemosh and all the other gods during the Summer of Chaos.

  <thing id="dei5CZeboi" name="Zeboim" description="Zeboim is goddess of the seas, storms, and strife. Her moods change with the storm, being calm one minute and in a violent rage the next. Zeboim is perhaps the most unpredictable of all the gods. Zeboim is twin to Nuitari, and the daughter of Takhisis and Sargonnas. Of all the gods, she detests Habbakuk the most. She feels that she should have sole domain over the sea, where he has dominion over sea creatures.\n\nZeboim is said to be mother of Ariakan, the son of Ariakas. She raised the isle that Storm&apos;s Keep rests on from the depths to serve as the headquarters of the Knights of Takhisis during the Chaos War. After the Chaos War and her son’s death, she had condemned Ausric Krell to become a death knight, where he would be trapped in Storm’s Keep forever. However in 422 AC, when she encountered the mortal Mina, she gave the girl her blessing to ultimately defeat Krell and aided her. Mina apparently defeated Krell and left Storm&apos;s Keep, however it was only afterwards that Zeboim realised she had been duped and that Krell had not been destroyed and that Mina was a disciple of Chemosh.\n\nRealising the duplicity of Mina, Zeboim then recruited the monk Rhys Mason to track down Mina and to attempt to ruin the plots of Chemosh. The goddess aided Rhys on numerous occasions, before learning that Chemosh contained the soul of her son Ariakan in a khas piece, which had since been given to Ausric Krell, who was located in Storm&apos;s Keep once more. Zeboim swore to free Ariakan from his prison, but was forced to play Chemosh&apos;s game for the time being, supporting him in taking over the dark pantheon.\n\nAt the behest of Zeboim, the kender Nightshade Pricklypear and the former monk Rhys Mason journeyed to Storm&apos;s Keep, where they tricked Ausric Krell and recovered the Ariakan khas piece. The adventurers returned the khas piece to Zeboim, although the goddess raged that she was unable to restore her son to his former form. Chemosh then contacted Zeboim, asking her aid in rescuing Mina from Nuitari, in return for restoring Ariakan&apos;s soul so he could live once more. The goddess sought out the Tower of the Blood Sea, where her twin was holding Mina and threatened to destroy the tower. Nuitari reluctantly released Mina into Zeboim&apos;s care, rather than see his tower destroyed. The goddess took Mina briefly to New Ports, to introduce Mina to her monk Rhys Mason, before returning her to the arms of Chemosh, and getting Ariakan&apos;s soul released. Zeboim then appeared to Mina at Castle Beloved, and gave her a set of black pearls, telling her they would grant her heart&apos;s desire, before vanishing once more.\n\nOn learning that Rhys Mason had forsaken her and returned to worshipping Majere, the goddess appeared in the Shrine of Zeboim and confronted her former monk. She demanded information about Mina and her origins, however Rhys was unable to comply. In punishment, she left him and his companions chained and stranded in her grotto. Zeboim then travelled to a distant temple of Majere, where she faced the god and tried to learn the secret of Mina from him. However Majere offered her nothing and she left in a huff. She would soon learn with her fellow gods that Mina was in truth a god herself. The goddess appeared genuinely upset that harm may befall Mina and even offered to take her beneath the waves and care for her as her own daughter... an offer which all the other gods were certain had ulterior motives. She then swore an oath with her fellow gods to not harm, seduce or try to sway Mina at all, but leave her to her own devices. Zeboim then appeared to Rhys Mason once more, only to learn that Mina was travelling with him, in the guise of a six year old girl. The goddess left in a huff, when Mina wanted nothing to do with her however. Although she later reappeared and told Mina she could use her powers to speed walk to Solace and further her journey, deciding to help the girl once more and showing her affection.\n\nIn 426 AC, Zeboim began plotting with her Mahkwahb followers to acquire all three known Impaling Thrones and flood the world with water." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

	 <thing id="dei5CMaglu" name="Maglubiyet" description="Maglubiyet, known as The Mighty One or The High Chieftain was the chief deity of goblins and hobgoblins as well as an exarch of Bane. He was a god of war and leadership who ruled over the goblin pantheon with an iron fist. As a god of war and a great general he was also known as The Battle Lord. Another of his aliases might be The Iron One, an aspect worshiped by the Grodd goblins.\n\nDescription\nMaglubiyet appeared as a 11 feet (3.4m) tall, black-skinned goblin with flaming eyes, powerfully-muscled arms and sharp talons. He wielded a mighty coal-black battleaxe that constantly dripped blood.\n\nDogma - Maglubiyet revels in conflict and destruction and constantly pushes his followers to wage war, particularly against dwarves and gnomes. He encourages goblins to increase their numbers in order to overrun their enemies. As a paranoid god he is prone to destroy lesser goblin deities when he suspects treachery or he thinks they are becoming too powerful." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

He acts as a trusted lieutenant of Maglubiyet, though he secretly harbors a desire to rule the goblin pantheon himself.\n\nKhurgorbaeyag appears as a large (9 feet tall) muscular goblin with flame-red skin, speckled with orange and yellow scales. He wears scale mail and carries a whip.\n\nKhurgorbaeyag believes his troops in the afterlife, the goblin spirits, must fight all the harder against their orcish rivals in order to compensate for the laziness and clumsiness of the hobgoblins. Khurgorbaeyag devotes his attention to the goblin race in particular (as oppose to goblinoids in general) and teaches that the oppression of humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings is the best route to ensure the safety of goblinkind." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="dei5CBargr" name="Bargrivyek" description="Bargrivyek is the goblin deity of cooperation and territory. He is known as the Peacekeeper because he tolerates no war between goblin tribes. However, he is not a gentle god and he desires to see goblins destroy their enemies, particularly orcs.\n\nBargrivyek appears as a large (8 feet tall) goblin with a high domed forehead. He wears a calm expression and carries a white-tipped flail.\n\nBargrivyek is on good terms with the goblins&apos; racial god, Khurgorbaeyag, because both desire the rise of goblins to domination of other races. He fears the head of the goblin pantheon, Maglubiyet, as well as the god of the hobgoblins, Nomog-Geaya.\n\nHruggek urges Maglubiyet to act against Bargrivyek, because Bargrivyek seeks to unite goblins and bugbears, something Hruggek disapproves of.\n\nBargrivyek&apos;s deceptively titled realm of The Peacable Lands can be found on Avernus, the first layer of Baator. Here he trains his goblin armies and leads raids against the realm of Kurtulmak, god of the kobolds.\n\nShamans of Bargrivyek strive to reduce conflicts amongst the goblins and turn aggression outwards toward external foes. They also advocate the expansion of goblin territory. Their holy weapon is the flail.\n\nBargrivyek sends omens to his clergy in the form of falling stars, speaking in strange tongues, and speech following violent stuttering." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="dei5CStalk" name="Stalker" description="Stalker is the goblinoid deity of hate, death, and cold. This god has no true worshippers, and is an enemy of all things that live. Its symbol is a creeping shadow.\n\nStalker was first detailed in the book Monster Mythology (1992), including details about his priesthood.\n\nStalker takes the form of a slow shadow, its size varying from two to twenty feet in length as the entity desires. It continuously radiates magical fear, and is especially proficient with cold-related spells. Stalker is related to the racial root stock of all goblinoid races (in this context, this includes orcs and other races as well). Stalker hungers for all lives and souls, but it is not powerful enough to oppose Gruumsh, Maglubiyet, or the races under their protection, so for this reason it focuses its hate on bugbears, kobolds, urds, gnolls, and mongrelfolk. It particularly despises Meriadar, who works to bring self-respect to the goblinoid races. Stalker occasionally strikes up an alliance with the bugbear god Skiggaret, with whom it has a mutual tolerance. Stalker is sometimes considered by bugbears to be a member of their pantheon.\n\nStalker will send its single avatar to prey on weak communities or those damaged by war. Other goblinoid gods will often permit Stalker to take a share of souls after such conflict, for they find its stirring up of violence to be useful. In pre-history, Stalker is said to have dwelled in a dark underground complex before being driven out by the intrusion of a goblinoid race. Ever since then, Stalker has wandered the world, searching for revenge. It is possible that Stalker is responsible for the pools of animated darkness haunting Darkpool; this is credited to an unnamed humanoid deity.\n\nStalker and its hate are strengthened by the deaths of goblinoids, so it always seeks to inspire war, conflict, and death. Stalker has no worshippers, but many fear it. It has no priests or shamans. Goblinoids usually do not bother to attempt to propitiate Stalker, as it seldom does any good. The only exception that has found to be effective is ritually dancing to death while promising Stalker a battle with deaths and souls to be devoured; this will sometimes satisfy Stalker enough to turn away from the rest of the community." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="dei5CMeria" name="Meriadar" description="Meriadar is a deity of patience, tolerance, meditation, and arts and crafts. His symbol is an artistically decorated bowl, which is used for sacramental feasting and sharing food with others.\n\nMeriadar is a patchwork creature like his chosen race. He is portrayed with an elf&apos;s ears, a dwarf&apos;s nose, a human chin, an orc&apos;s jaw, and a gnome&apos;s eyes. Other details of his appearance—height, build, skin tone, and so on—change from moment to moment. He can also appear as a tall figure of any humanoid race. He wears simple brown robes.\n\nMeriadar frequently sends omens in the form of automatic speech and speaking in tongues during philosophical debates, sudden artistic inspiration, automatic drawing and sculpting, strange scents, and smoky, vaporous images emerging from bubbles in bowls of soup.\n\nMeriadar teaches patience and respect to all creatures. He expects open-mindedness and compassion, and expects his followers to attempt to meet and befriend other races. He encourages the mongrelfolk to blend in with other races when they can, remembering that they represent the logical conclusion of a mixed society.\n\nMeriadar teaches that arts and crafts are an important avenue for exploring peacefulness. Those who respect one another&apos;s creativity and skill are unlikely to act violently toward one another, he reasons.\n\nMeriadar is mostly pacifistic, though he will send avatars to defend mongrelfolk communities that are in danger of being wiped out completely. He will generally not act to prevent more ordinary suffering, as he believes that suffering can be a road that leads to greater spiritual enlightenment.\n\nAnother tenet of Meriadar&apos;s dogma is the concept of the &quot;eternal now.&quot; This is a complex and subtle philosophical idea that parallels the act of drawing sustenance in a spiritual sense. Hunger, the most basic drive, is also the most immediate one, and is therefore akin to the awareness of the present, which is unchanged by past or future.\n\nMeridar&apos;s chief worshippers are mongrelfolk and non-evil humanoids of any type. He seeks to redeem evil humanoids such as orcs and goblinoids, or provide a place of refuge for those of them not drawn toward evil. He particularly prizes bugbear followers, being glad to keep them away from their own chaotic gods. On the plane of Arcadia he is served by a female bugbear who wanders near the realm of Clangeddin, preaching peace to the dwarves there." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">
