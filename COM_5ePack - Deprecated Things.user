Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.\n\nThe berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting o f this spell." compset="Spell">

If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.\n\nThis spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4)." compset="Spell">

  <thing id="sp5CFindFa" name="Deprecated - Find Familiar" description="You choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or w easel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. The familiar will serve you. \n\nYour familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\n\nWhen the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.\n\nWhile your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\n\nAs an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. \n\nYou can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\n\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll." compset="Spell">

The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.\n\nThe target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part o f your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range. \n\nWhen the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft." compset="Spell">

The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.\n• You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.\n• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.\n• You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire." compset="Spell">
