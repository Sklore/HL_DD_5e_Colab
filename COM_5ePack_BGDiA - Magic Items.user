Since his imprisonment, Gargauth’s evil has warped the shield’s appearance, so that its celestial appearance has become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways.\n\nWhile holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.\n\nSentience. The Shield of the Hidden Lord is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:\n\n    The {iShield of the Hidden Lord{/i}  has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet.\n    It can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.\n    It has 3 charges that it regains  at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast fireball or 2 charges to cast wall of fire from the shield (save DC 21 for each). The wall of fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n    Anytime during your turn, the {iShield of the Hidden Lord{/i} can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (The shield controls this, not the wirlder.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can’t use it again until the next dawn.\n\n{b}Gargauth’s Personality.{/b} Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can’t escape on its own. The pit fiend won’t reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.\n\nWhile trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield’s current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual’s soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield’s owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.\n\nGargauth doesn’t know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it’s brought to the Nine Hells, for it’s convinced that the shield’s powers are weaker there.\n\n{b}Freeing Gargauth.{/b} Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth’s name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible." compset="MagicArmor">

Each such coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin contains a unique soul, each has a story. \n\n{b}Carrying Soul Coins.{/b} To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it\n\nAn evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.\n\n{b}Using a Soul Coin.{/b} A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:\n\n{b}1) Drain Life.{/b} You siphon away some of the soul’s essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.\n\n{b}2) Query.{/b} You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.\n\n{b}Freeing a Soul.{/b} Casting {i}remove curse{/i} or a similar spell on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin’s charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of its god or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM’s choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.\n\nA soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine’s furnace (see &quot;Soul Fuel&quot;).\n\nFreeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.\n\n{b}Hellish Currency.{/b} Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.\n\nSoul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes." compset="Wondrous" stacking="merge">

These wings grant you a flying speed of 90 feet and you can hover.

Your vision can see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically penetrates visual illusions and succeeds on saving throws against them. In addition you can perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic, and see into the Ethereal Plane. The range of all these abilities is 60 feet.\n\n{b}New Personality.{/b} You gain new personality traits, determined by rolling once on each of the following tables. These traits override any conflicting personality trait, ideal, bond, or flaw. {i}(see Sword of Zariel in the magic items appendix of the Baldur&apos;s Gate: Descent into Avernus module){/i}\n\n{b}Holy Light.{/b} The {b}Sword of Zariel{/b} sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for another 5 feet beyond that. Fiends find this light disconcerting and painful, even if they can’t see it. Fiends have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the weapon’s radius of bright light.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can intensify the sword’s light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.\n\n{b}Random Properties.{/b} The {b}Sword of Zariel{/b} has 2 minor beneficial properties, each determined by rolling on the {i}Minor Beneficial Properties{/i} table in chapter 7 of the {i}Dungeon Master’s Guide{/i}. See the Epic Boons tab.\n\n{b}Searing Radiance.{/b} The {b}Sword of Zariel{/b}  deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 (3d10) radiant damage if you’re wielding the weapon with two hands. Evil creatures that takes the radiant damage must make a DC 17 Constitution save or be blinded until the end of its next turn.\n\n{b}Sentience.{/b} The {b}Sword of Zariel{/b} is a sentient with a  lawful good alignment. It possesses an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet. The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.\n\n{b}Truth Seer.{/b} While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks.\n\n{i}{/b}Destroying the Sword.{/b} Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it.
