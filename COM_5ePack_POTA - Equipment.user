While you&apos;re wearing the backpack, you can deploy the balloon as an action and gain the effect of the levitate spell for 10 minutes, targeting yourself and  requiring no concentration. \n\nAlternatively, you can use a reaction to deploy the balloon when you&apos;re falling and gain the effect of the feather fall spell for yourself.\n\nWhen either spell ends, the balloon slowly deflates as the elemental spirit escapes and returns to the Elemental Plane of Air. As the balloon deflates, you descend gently toward the ground for up to 60 feet. If you are still in the air at the end of this distance, you fall if you have no other means of staying aloft. \n\nAfter the spirit departs, the backpack&apos;s property is unusable unless the backpack is recharged for 1 hour in an elemental air node, which binds another spirit to the backpack." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="io5CDevOrb" name="Devastation Orb" description="A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.\n\nA devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates Id 100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to\nexplode instantly.\n\nA special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols ofthe orb&apos;s opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes ld6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container. \n\nRegardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere&apos;s point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use. \n\nAir Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a powerful windstorm that lasts for 1 hour. Whenever a creature ends its turn exposed to the wind, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take ld4 bludgeoning damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure. Otherwise, the rules for strong wind apply, as detailed in chapter 5 ofthe Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide. \n\nEarth Orb. When this orb detonates, it subjects the area to the effects ofthe earthquake spell for 1 minute (spell save DC 18). For the purpose ofthe spell&apos;s effects, the spell is cast on the turn that the orb explodes. \n\nFire Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for extreme heat apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide. At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself  out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage. \n\nWater Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a torrential rainstorm that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 ofthe Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2dl0 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches\nthe edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood&apos;s path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain." compset="Wondrous">

You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the water weird to retract into it or if the water weird is dead. \n\nIf the water weird is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new water weird forms inside it. \n\nThe tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the water weird contained within it." compset="Wondrous">
