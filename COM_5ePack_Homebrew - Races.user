  <thing id="r5CUrsine" name="Ursine" description="Nestled at the base of a large mountain range, the Ursine village lies at the edge of an ever-present maelstrom, the Gelid Vortex, which hovers just beyond the protective rim of mountains. Battling through frigid winters, the Ursine are a hardy race with centuries of tradition to call back upon.\n\nAnimalistic\nThough many see the Ursine as intelligent bears, there are many differences between the Ursine and their savage cousin. A fully grown Ursine is much smaller than a bear and is as nimble on his hind legs as he is on all four. Outsiders may find it hard to believe, but the rough Ursine have much more restrain and self-control than the beasts they are often mistaken for, though some suspect this is a result of their lack of need to hibernate. \n\nStrong and Tough\nYears of living in the rough northern lands of the Freljord have made the Ursine tough. The harsh winters at the base of a mountain range often lead to lack of food, requiring many of the Ursine to survive off of the tough plant life native to the Freljord. Though many of the other races have trouble with the low temperatures of the north, the Ursine are barely affected by the cold, instead kept warm by their fur coats.\n\nHomeland Traditions\nMany Ursine choose to wander the world in their formative years, curious about the state of the rest of the world. However, most of which who go out often return to their home, either because they miss their home or their curiosity has been sated. As a result of the journeying many Ursine do, the ageold traditions of the Ursine are an eclectic mix, with bits and pieces taken from the other cultures of the land. \n\nHistory of War\nIn the past, long ago, the Ursine were a warrior race, savage, fierce, and disciplined. However, once peace arrived at Freljord, the Ursine settled down and much of their war-like temperament was lost. \n\nThis changed once Volibear, the town shaman, had visions of a brutul conflict. Journeying to the top of the mountain, he was touched by an unnatural bolt of lightning. Journeying to his village, he roused his people and began returning them to the state of their fore-fathers, proud warriors.\n\nUrsine Names\nUrsine name their young based on what they want them to achieve as adults. An aggressive, war-like Ursine may give his son a rough, cacophonous name while another might name her son after the hero of an Ursine folk tale.\n\nMale Ursine Names: Arrus, Anrun, Callun, Deruhs, Leneth, Marukus, Olland, Rutushush, Veeros, Wlaren \nFemale Ursine Names: Arsa, Belara, Dalara, Edulla, Hoinda, Ollinde, Nacura, Neruna, Warra\n\nSource: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ttoyMfsaC7M01uTHFfYWhFNlU/view?usp=sharing" compset="Race">

  <thing id="r5CSharMin" name="Shardmind" description="Crystalline Constructs\nShardminds are beings made of tiny crystal fragments held together by intense focus. This focus allows them to shape their bodies to look humanoid, but must be maintained at all times. Some are so skilled at controlling tiny crystal fragments that their skin appears to be almost human-like. When a Shardmind is stunned or unconscious, some fragments float away into orbit around him until he has the chance to regain control.\n\nEclectic Minds\nThe psionic power that a Shardmind possesses comes from the fact that, in essence, he is a fragment of pure thought. Some of them can be very rational and calculating, but others are empathetic, timid, or hot-tempered. However, at the same time they all approach life like newborn babes, embracing the experiences around them and attempting to incorporate the vast stores of knowledge now open to them. \n\nPieces of a Whole\nAlthough there are various tales of the origin of Shardminds, one thing that they all agree on is that they all came from the same entity, an ancient construct of great power that fell to pieces in a catastrophe that they have dubbed The Fracturing. Some say that they were once part of a great gate that was created to connect across unknown worlds. Others believe they were an entity created by the gods to deliver justice. Whatever they believe about their origin, they all know that each Shardmind is a piece of the thought of that construct, and all of them have a longing to see themselves become whole again.\n\nShardmind Names\nAs Shardminds are constructs given life through psionic power, they aren’t bound by gender the way that most races are. Therefore, all of their names are gender-neutral. \n\nShardmind Names: Amata, Arshaka, Arwia, Balashi, Bashanu, Belessunu, Dipana, Erishti, Eshunu, Hunzu, Iltani, Ishmae, Kuaya, Kubaba, Kuri, Manishtu, Naran, Nuraya, Seluku, Tabni, Ubashu, Utau, Zakiti\n\nSource: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ttoyMfsaC7M01uTHFfYWhFNlU/view?usp=sharing" compset="Race">

  <thing id="r5CMousefo" name="Mousefolk" description="{i}OBSCURED IN THETHICK UNDERBRUSH of the forest, every muscle in Moira’s body was screaming. She had been crouched, completely still, for half a day, waiting for her quarry to emerge from its den. Thick mud clumped and matted her dark fur, insulating her from the high sun. Her large round ears twitched, focusing on a faint scratching coming from the cave. Her prey was awake. Moira drew her bow and deftly nocked an arrow without a sound. She waited. Soon the mighty owlbear lumbered out of the cave. A dry summer had forced it closer to civilization, and it had begun preying on trade caravans. Moira took aim, andl et fly her arrow. The Barbed Trail would be safe to travel once more.{/i}\n\nThe life of the Mouse folk is one spent close to the ground. With no great empires or kingdoms to call home, the Mousefolk spend their lives carving a place for themselves in the cities of the larger races or in the untamed wilds. They form tight-knit communities where every member is expected to contribute to the success of the whole. Some Mousefolk study a trade skill to support their families, while others use their natural agility and intellect for contract services.\n\n{b}FURRY AND NIMBLE{/b}\nReaching a little over 2 feet tall, the Mousefolk often go unnoticed in their day to day activities. Their diminutive stature and quiet demeanor make the Mousefolk inoffensive to most, granting a certain detachment from the major conflicts and strife of the age. Their fast metabolisms and quick feet give the Mousefolk a slender build, usually weighing between 20-30 pounds.\n\nMousefolk fur color ranges from white to tan to brown or black, with various patterns passed through heredity. They take care to groom and clean their fur, as it represents their family and community. A Mousefolk’s eye color is either red or black. Mousefolk like to wear comfortable dark colored clothes that allow for discretion and a wide range of movement. \n\nThe concept of personal wealth or glory doesn’t pervade through Mousefolk culture, most actions taken are for the good of the community rather than the self. Any wealth or resources gained are utilized for the betterment of the group. Some Mousefolk, however, use their natural abilities for personal gain. These individuals tend to be outcasts or black sheep of the clans.\n\n{b}HOME AND HEARTH{/b}\nThe Mousefolk are a resourceful and tenacious race. Mousefolk settlements can be found in the most unlikely and inhospitable of places. They tend to build homes in the dark shadows and forgotten corners of the world, such as city slums, deep forests, scorching deserts, arctic tundras, or port cities in exotic lands. The Mousefolk aren&apos;t typically farmers, instead preferring hunting, trade, and craft to meet their needs. Mousefolk caravans are not an easy target for bandits, guarded by skilled archers within and a bristling wall of oak and steel without.\n\nMousefolk families extend beyond blood ties, an individual&apos;s entire community is treated as kin. Mousefolk settlers will seek out other colonies, and new warrens will arise within close proximity to each other. These communities will eventually grow and merge, the members of each becoming kin to the other.\n\n{b}ARTISANS AND ADVENTURERS{/b}\nThe Mousefolk have a deep love of art, literature, song, and craft, and will often spend a lifetime perfecting their trade. True masterworks are rarely seen by the outside world, instead they are preserved and passed through the generations. To be a keeper of lore and heritage is among the highest honors and greatest responsibilities in Mousefolk culture.\nThe Mousefolk who do not end up learning a trade will often put their skills to use pursuing\n\n{b}VIRTUOUS AND HEADSTRONG{/b}\nDespite their generally flighty appearance, mousefolk are a very honorable people. They believe strongly in personal honor, less so in the idea that the actions of others can impugn that honor. When a mousefolk makes a mistake, especially one that causes harm to others, they will work hard and at long lengths to correct that mistake.\nesoteric knowledge, training as defenders, spiritual leaders, rangers, covert agents, or they might even travel the world as an adventurer-for-hire.\n\n{B}MOUSEFOLK NAMES{/B}\nWhen a Mousefolk is old enough to read, they are taken by an elder to the clan&apos;s archives to study the lore and histories of their people. After several years, the individual is allowed to pick their own name, either adopting the name of a past hero, or inventing a new name for themselves.\n\n{b}Male Names: {/b}Aengus, Ashwin, Aynselle, Boris, Byrnstan, Celanawe, Colin, Demitri, Elric, Esegar, Finn, Gregory, Joseph, Luke, Martin, Matthias, Mattimeo, Odric, Seyth, Thom, Wald win \n{b}Female Names:{/b} Baeylie, Caley, Clove, Daewn,\nDalla, Eda, Elis, Gale, Ingrid, Kearra, Mariel, Millicent, Moira, Nola, Rona, Rosalee, Sayble, Serra, Sylvia, Veira \n{b}Historical Names:{/b} Abershaw, Bluebell, Dalgill,\nFaolan, Garrow, Gamilon, Grimwold, Hannidy, Larkin, Sloan, Taryn, Tenny, Tinble, Toller, Vidar, Walmond\n\nSource: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6eHVaEIoWbBZWRid0tkMnhPMXM/view" compset="Race">
