In any case, the Exorcism domain is never a deity&apos;s only domain, but a small and active arm of a greater Church. In rare cases, nature deities take a strong enough position against the intrusion of creatures from Outside that they consecrate a cleric with the power to banish intruders.\n\nAs paladins and many clerics defend their faith and innocents under their care against physical threats, including warfare, pestilence, and oppression, exorcists defend against spiritual threats from other planes: celestials (particularly evil or fallen angels), elementals, fey, and fiends. These enemies may manifest in subtle ways, and an exorcist must exercise great insight to root them out without destroying innocents in the process.\n\nSource: http://harbinger-of-doom.blogspot.com.au/2015/02/d-5e-exorcism-domain.html" compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cHB5CImpBo" name="Improved Bomb" description="Starting at 5th level you learn how to enhance simple destructive alchemical items. This works just like your bomb ability but in addition to adding damage you can also apply one of the following effects: \n\nArea affect – you change the bomb so that instead of targeting a single target it affects an area 10ft wide. Anything caught in the blast must make a check or suffer the normal effects of the bomb.  \n\nBlinding – Creatures that are hit by the bomb must make a Constitution save (DC equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be blinded for 1 minute. \n\nDelayed - The bomb can be placed so that it explodes a number of rounds after you cease contact with it. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by you, up to a number of rounds equal to your level. If at any point you reclaim possession of the delayed bomb, you can end the timer and prevent the bomb’s detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb’s contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and half damage to all adjacent creatures (Dex save negates). You cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. You create another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. Dispel magic can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus). \n\nStinky – In addition to the normal effects, the bomb also produces a 10 foot radius cloud of noxious gas. The cloud’s area is lightly obscured. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your intelligence modifier + proficiency bonus). On a failed save the creature spends its next turn chocking and retching. This cloud lasts for 1 round.  \n\nSticky – A bomb you add the sticky affect to becomes slightly adhesive. This either produces an effect identical to a tanglefoot bag when you throw the item at a target (but only affecting the target of the attack) or makes the vial itself stick to a target, granting you advantage on the attack you make with the alchemical item (since it sticks to its target).  \n\nStarting at 10thlevel you can add two affects from this list to a single bomb. At 15thlevel you can add up to three effects from this list one bomb." compset="ClSpecial">

This discovery is chosen from the list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many alchemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work. \n\nPotion of Perfected Form – You brew a single one time use potion that either increases a single mental ability score (either Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) by 2 points up to a maximum of 22, or permanently grants you advantage on all checks made with a single mental ability score (your choice). In addition this potion stops your aging process giving you eternal youth.  Grand Elixir of Regeneration – You create a onetime use elixir that grants you (only you) permanent regeneration. After imbibing the potion you regenerate 10 hit points at the start of each of your turns.  \n\nPhilosopher’s Stone – You’ve learned how to create a philosopher&apos;s stone, and can do so once per month at no cost. Creating a philosopher&apos;s stone takes 1 day of work. A Philosopher’s Stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open a cavity is revealed at the stone&apos;s heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables you to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher&apos;s stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp) before being consumed. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period. The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon. \n\nPotion of True Invisibility - You can create a potion of true invisibility and may do so once a week with no cost. A potion of true invisibility can only be used by you but once used it renders you invisible for 1 hour no matter if you attack or not. In addition while under the effects of a potion of true invisibility you are impossible to scry and it’s impossible to gain any information on you using any divination spell that is not divine in origin." compset="ClSpecial">

Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in resp onse. \n\nWhile inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for concentration plus up to 1 round per level, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As an action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud&apos;s original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath&apos;s area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud&apos;s original DC.

  <thing id="cHB5CMutag" name="Mutagen" description="As a 5th level follower of the Principle of Lead you have discovered how to create a mutagen that you can imbibe in order to heighten your physical prowess.  It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time. If you brew a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again. \n\nWhen you brew a mutagen select one physical ability score; either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It takes an action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +1 bonus to AC and grants advantage to all attacks, checks and saves you make with your chosen ability. This effect lasts for 1 hour per alchemist level.  A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a Constitution save (DC 8 + your Intelligence modifier) or become nauseated (retching and unable to take actions) for 1 hour. \n\nA non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but as an alchemist you can gain the effects of another alchemist&apos;s mutagen if you drink it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end." compset="ClSpecial">

The explosion inflicts 1d8 points of damage of that energy type per caster level (maximum 10d8) to all creatures and unattended objects within 15 feet, and half that amount to targets past 15 feet but within 30 feet. Creatures can make a Dex saving throw for half damage. You are unaffected by the damage from the explosion." compset="Spell">

  <thing id="cHelpAch" name="Alchemist" description="Deep in the caverns of a mystic dungeon, a group of adventurers count their gold as an elf extracts the venom from a giant snake, pocketing it in her pouch. \n\nIn a busy part of the city, a human rushes to find the right potion for the poor family. It might not stop the disease, but the child will live to fight another day. \n\nAlchemists strive to learn the mysteries of nature, manipulating it in ways only they know. While not technically spell casters, they&apos;re magical in their own right, and the effects of their concoctions provide much to any adventuring party. \n\nStudy and Practice\nAlchemists are studied professionals but study is only half the battle. To unlock the true mysteries of the world, experimentation is in order. Alchemists collect ingredients which they use to practice their craft in hopes of discovering a new way to change the world, whether for the better or worse. \n\nResearchers\nIn society, alchemists are usually recluses, and even medicinal doctors aren&apos;t the most popular people, though they are found to be vital to any city. However, in an adventuring party, the intellectual mind of an alchemist can be the voice of reason, and a valuable ally for their limitless uses in combat and exploration. \n\nAlchemists have several sub schools of research, mainly explosives, poisons, and potions, but many areas of study exist, as the possibilities of alchemy are limitless. Some study to become medicinal experts, while others strive to strengthen the body and mind. Whatever the case, their goals are to better every aspect of our lives. \n\nCreating an Alchemist\nFirst, decide what your character might be studying. Is he studying to heal their village who had no way to cure diseases, or is he finding ways to make exploring dungeons safer and easier? Are you studying yourself, or did you learn from someone else? Did you spend your days perfecting your current recipes, or discovering new ones?\n\nWhat was your first exposure to alchemy? Were you poisoned and someone made a traditional herb to heal you making you search for new healing methods, or did you hear the sounds of explosions and wish to make your own brand of thunderous noise? Think about this as you decide what concoctions to focus on as you research the world. \n\nQuick Build\nFollow these guidelines when creating an alchemist. Firstly, intelligence should be your highest stat, followed by dexterity if you plan on being the adventurous type, or charisma if you plan on dealing with people on a regular basis. Second, chose the hermit background. \n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3wwmh6/the_alchemist_a_non_magical_variant/" compset="Class" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cHelpBlH" name="Blood Hunter" description="In a landscape tormented by all manner of beasts, devils, and abominations from beyond the veil, most live in fear of the dark, of superstition, and of the unknown. Some grow hardened by this experience, instead choosing to stand up and fight against the tide of shadow. These folk are called heroes.\n\nSome, however, are so fanatical and bent on destroying the anethema that plagues the countryside that they embrace dark, forbidden knowledge. They sacrifice some of their own vital force in dubious, forgotten blood rituals to better understand their enemies. Their methods sometimes blur the line between themselves and the evils they hunt, calling their own humanity into question. These folk are called &apos;Blood Hunters.\n\nBECOME THE ENEMY TO UNDERSTAND THE ENEMY\nThese warriors have chosen to merge the martial pursuit of deadly weapon play with elements of vicious blood magic to create impressively effective combat techniques. They surrender their own vitality to form a bond with their weapon, allowing them to harness the elements in a whirlwind of dangerous strikes. Their deep knowledge and unnatural connection with wicked creatures allows them an advantage in tracking, hunting, and destroying even the most resilient of abhorrent fiends. By mastering control over their own lifeblood and the lifeblood of others, they gain insight into their foes and the ability to manipulate them from the inside. Some brew crude, poisonous alchemical tonics from the harvested organs of felled monsters, mutating their blood and bodies to be even further in tune with their quarry, becoming something other than human themselves. Others go further, reaching out and making a pact with lesser dark entities in hopes of using their grim gifts against greater evils. Many blood hunters push too far for their goals, falling to their own hubris and becoming the monsters they&apos;ve chosen to hunt. This is the greatest fear of a blood hunter, and of the societies at large that shun them.\n\nALMOST AS FEARED AS THEIR PREY\nThe nature of their abilities and training has bred many rumors across the lands, some of which aren&apos;t too far from the truth. Common folk consider them cursed, often turning them away at the door. Nobles see them as occasionally convenient, but a generally revilled nuisance. Mages find them useful allies if kept at arm&apos;s length, while pious clerics and paladins keep their distance with a watchful eye. To be a blood hunter is to accept a life of solitude until proven trustworthy and dependable.\n\nCREATING A BLOOD HUNTER\nAs you create your blood hunter, keep in mind how your character relates to society and why they have taken to a life of monster hunting. Do they wish to protect society and as such have paid the ultimate price? Do they have a family they wish to protect at all costs? Did they make a mistake that cost then greatly, and they wish to make amends for their folly? Or are they bent on vengeance for Some past Wound or loss that drove them to choose this dark warrior&apos;s path?\n\nWhile a blood hunter begins their journey alone, they also acknowledge the strength in numbers and the benefits of trusted companions. Many blood hunters keep allies to both ensure that they succeed at their hunts, and to keep a Watchful eye to prevent them from losing touch with their humanity. A blood hunter without conviction is lost, and often an honest friend is enough to keep then from straying.\n\nQUICK BUILD\nYou can make a blood hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highestability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee Weapons, or ranged and finesse Weapons. Make Wisdom your next highest if you plan to focus on the potency of blood curses and mystical power. Choose a higher Constitution next if you wish to use Crimson Rite on multiple weapons or Want to have extra hit points to burn on amplifying blood curses. Then, select the Haunted One or Acolyte background. \n\nBlood Hunter 1.7\nSource: http://www.dmsguild.com/product/170777/Blood-Hunter-Class?hot60=1&amp;src=hottest_filtered&amp;filters=45469" compset="Class" uniqueness="unique">

While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1.d4 rite damage of the chosen elemental type. Rite damage is considered magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain blood hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite damage die column of the blood hunter table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon thrown fades directly after the attack is complete.\n\nWhen a crimson rite is activated, it reduces your maximum hit points a number equal to your character level. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored otherwise. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoring of maximum hit points.\n\nCrimson rite can be used on multiple weapons, costing additional hit point loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a separate weapon for the purposes of this feature. A rite can be allowed to fade at any time (no action required).\n\nYou gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level. You may learn an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.\n\nPRIMAL RITES\nChoose from the following:\nRite of the Flame. Your rite damage is fire type. \nRite of the Frozen, Your rite damage is cold type. \nRite of the Storm. Your rite damage is lightning type.\n\nESOTERC RITES\nChoose from the following:\nRite of the Roar. Your rite damage is thunder type. \nRite of the Oracle.

Those that shun the curse spend their lives burying their wild, bestial urges deep inside. However, the power of a rising full moon makes the curse too strong to resist, and the host transforms into a terrifying animal-humanoid hybrid controlled by murderous impulse. Those that embrace the dark nature of their curse learn to harness their bestial gifts, but also succumb to the evil, vicious temperament that drives the beast within.\n\nThe Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo &quot;The Taming&quot;, a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one&apos;s own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order&apos;s blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.\n\nSource: http://www.dmsguild.com/product/175606/Order-of-the-Lycan-for-Blood-Hunters?src=also_purchased&amp;filters=45469" compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="unique">
