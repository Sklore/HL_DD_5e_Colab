New 5e Pack released! Please give a big [B][I]Thank You to Fenris447[/I][/B] for his fantastic job on getting this finished!

[b]v2.5 November 9, 2020[/b]
[b]NEW RELEASES[/b]
[list]
[*] Eberron: Rising from the Last War/Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron - Aberrant Dragonmark replaced, Greater Aberrant Dragonmark added. Due to Hero Lab limitations, there are some manual components to tracking used Hit Dice for this ability.
[*] Mordenkainenâ€™s Tome of Foes - Fiendish Boons and Cults added. Using the eponymous adjustment will add a tab for selecting Demonic Boons and/or Devil Cults. The variant cambion features can be accessed through choosing the appropriate fiend in this tab, too.
[*] Mythic Odysseys of Theros - Races, subclasses, background, deities (and their benefits), and supernatural gifts added.
[*] Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants - Cleric Blessed Strikes added.
[*] Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic - Added full UA. Special thanks to MardukBathory for providing the descriptive text, which was used for all the class features. Please see the known issues section.
[/list]

**ENHANCEMENTS & CHANGES**
[list]
[*] 2020 Errata Implemented - A lot more than this, but note: the Kobold and Orc have had their negative stat modifiers removed. Use an Ability Score adjustment if you want to go back. The VGM Orc now matches the Wildemount and Eberron version, so the newer one has been deprecated. Users of the newer version will need to re-select the VGM version when they update.
[*] EGTW - Hollow One moved to the Supernatural Gifts tab.
[/list]

**BUGS**
[list]
[*] BGDIA - Fixed incorrect version of Detect Magic on two monsters. Added cone size on Hollyphant Trumpet.
[*] MM - Added missing attack and damage type on Spined Devil
[*] MTG - Added sources to Amonkahet deities
[*] PHB - Added sources to goblinoid deities
[*] SCAG - Corrected errors in Totem Spirit descriptions
[*] UACFV - Fixed incorrect version of Detect Magic on Primal Awareness
[*] XGTE - Fixed Storm Aura description formatting and typo, fixed Kensei weapons not including darts
[/list]

**KNOWN ISSUES**
[list]
[*] Most 2.3 issues still ongoing, but plans to fix them are in place.
[*] UA Modern Magic - The UA indicates that Sidearms and Long arms are in the DMG, but they are not. A handful of features in this UA use them, so DMs and players may need to either create some homebrew weapons of their own, or use a combination of existing weapons and proficiency adjustments to achieve something closer to what they want.

<strong>ENHANCEMENTS & CHANGES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Custom Output for Fantasy Grounds - You can find the discussion thread on the forums http://forums.wolflair.com/showthread.php?t=60176</li>
<li>DMG - Minor and major beneficial and detrimental properties have been added as Epic Boons with informational drop-down menus.</li>
<li>PHB (Merchant variant) - There is a new background choice for folks that wanted a Guild Merchant and decided to choose two languages but no Navigator's Tool proficiency. This will show up in the background lists as "Guild Merchant (Lang. Var.)".</li>
<li>PHB - Magic Initiate and Ritual Caster feats have been enhanced so that when Find Familiar is chosen, the Add a Familiar dialogue link will show up on the 1st class assigned to a PC. The link will show up on either the Spells tab or the Class tab. This feat does not work on NPCs, they will need to still use the Add Familiar or Add Companion adjustments.</li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana: Kits of Old - Added the Scout subclass for Fighter.</li>
<li>2018 Errata Implemented - A lot of the 2018 errata changes are part of the SRD, which is controlled in Hero Lab by LWD. We've updated whatever is outside the SRD</li>
<li>SKT - A pig statblock has been added. You heard me.</li>
</ul>
<strong>BUGS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple - Many classes, langauges, races, and items have had missing sources added to them, and they will now only show up when the appropriate source is selected.</li>
<li>CoS - Haunted One background now grants 2 skill proficiencies as per errata corrections published.</li>
<li>DMG - Boon of Quick Casting was only working for classes that memorized spells, this has been fixed to include casters like warlocks and bards that spontaneously cast spells known.</li>
<li> DMG - Pelor's alignment has been fixed</li>
<li> DMG - Wave and the Staff of the Adder have been fixed to not show as standard weapons</li>
<li> LMOP - The Spider Staff has had its poison damage added</li>
<li> SCAG - Barbarian (Path of the Totem Warrior) - The Tree Ghost totem ability was not removing the Speak with Animals spell from the UI on the iPad. This has been addressed. </li>
<li> SCAG/XGTE (Sword Coast & Xanathars) - Rogue (Mastermind) - _Master of Intrigue_ was not granting the disguise kit and forgery kit profiencies as expected. This has been fixed. </li>
<li> UA Gothic - Fixed the Fighter Archetype of Monster Hunter for the Bonus Proficiencies.</li>
<li> UA Starter Spells - Fixed classes for many spells.</li>
<li> XGTE (Xanathar's Guide) - _Flames of Phlegethos_ and _Infernal Constitution_ were generating errors for the community Tiefling. Changed the prerequisite scripting to reflect the community replacements. </li>
<li> XGTE - All spells are now no longer marked "Not Allowed for Adventurers League Characters"</li>
<li> XGTE - Forge Domain abilities from _Soul of the Forge_ and _Saint of Forge and Fire_ were being granted at 1st level, this has been fixed and they properly add now. </li>
<li> XGTE - Path of the Kensei - Longsword and other weapons allowed by the _Path of the Kensei_ selections were not being marked as martial arts weapons and receiving the proper attribute bonus or damage at high level. This has been fixed.</li>
<li> XGTE - The Celestial (Warlock) - _Celestial Resilience_ was granting temporary hit points before level 10. This has been fixed and the entire adjustment will now show up as a temporary hit point pool on the In-Play tab so that the temporary hit points can be shown and removed correctly. An adjustment has also been created so that other players affected can choose the adjustment and get a temporary hit point pool with proper naming and behavior. </li>
<li> XGTE - Warlock Invocations - _Improved Pact Weapon_ was not granting the +1 bonus to magical weapons that did not already have a bonus (e.g. Flame Tongue weapons). This has been fixed. </li>
<li> XGTE - Pact Weapon/Hexblade - When a two-handed magic weapon was selected to be the Pact of the Blade weapon, the Hexblade Hex Warrior weapon selection was returning an invalid selection dialogue and an error was thrown. This is now functioning as intended. </li>
</ul>
<strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong>
<ul>
<li> Artificer (2019): Spells and cantrips must be manually added at level 1 due to programming limitations with Hero Lab. Should function normally at level 2 and beyond. Multiclassing rounds down, not up like it should, also due to programming limitations. Thus the Artificer is incomplete, and will remain that way without changes from LWD.</li>
<li> GGR - Tireless Precision's implementation is suboptimal and doesn't play nice with other proficiency adds</li>
<li> GGR - The Elf and Human races cannot be given the GGtR source</li>
<li> DMG - The amount of ammunition loaded into a firearm isn't currently trackable</li>
<li> DMG - Minor/major beneficial/detrimental item properties show up as selectable Epic Boons and have no scripting to implement their features.</li>
</ul>

<li>Unearthed Arcana - The Ranger, Revised - The Ranger (2016) variant class' Fighting Styles were stacking with Fighting Styles earned from other classes or features, this has been fixed. The _'broken'_ fighting styles will show up with ' - Depreciated' added to the end of their names. The Depreciated fighting styles have been removed from the choices presented when Fighting Style is selected again, so only Fighting Styles that haven't been earned via another class or feat will show up on the selection dialog. </li>
<li>Unearthed Arcana - Gothic Heroes - The revenant race is depreciated. Dragonborn characters gain a Revenant draconic ancestry, which prompts for the original draconic ancestry and modifies the breath weapon appropriately. Many races with subrace options gain an appropriate Revenant subrace option. Finally, Humans and many other PC races were granted a Revenant variant racial trait. Select the '5e Unearthed Arcana - Gothic Heroes' source in Configure Hero (Ctrl-K) to explore the revised options.</li>
