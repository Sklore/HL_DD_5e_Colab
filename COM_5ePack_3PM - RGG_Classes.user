Whether you were born with this connection, gained it through forbidden study, or were the victim of cruel experimentation, you are never alone in the darkness.  Who or what the whispers are is subject for debate, but the ethereal creatures you’ve befriended have taught you secrets from long ago and far away. You carry exotic weapons and have learned unique fighting styles not seen in generations, or from cultures you’ve yet to meet." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Shadow Warrior Rogue Archetype" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="c5CSWEWP" name="Exotic Weapon Training" description="When you select this archetype at 3rd level you gain proficiency with nets and whips.\nChoose a melee weapon with which you are proficient. The weapon you choose may not have the heavy property. You may replace the weapon’s normal damage type with bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.\nIn addition, you may add one of the following properties to that weapon if it does not already possess it: finesse, reach, thrown (20/60), versatile (increase damage die by 1 when used two handed). This weapon property is the result of your training as well as the unique design of the weapon. The weapon loses this additional property while being used by a character that isn’t trained in its use (subject to DM’s approval).\nYou possess one weapon of this type at 3rd level. If the weapon is broken or lost, you may repair or replace the weapon during downtime activities in a city of appropriate size or nature (such as a trade port), or by using the appropriate tool kit, or by instructing a skilled smith in the weapon’s design.\nYou continue to train in exotic weapons as you advance in level. You may use this class feature again at 8th, 13th, and 18th level, gaining up to four exotic weapons.\nExamples: Many shadow warriors train in the use of spiked or weighted chains as weapons. Adding the versatile property to a whip and changing the damage type to either piercing or bludgeoning creates a two-handed chain weapon that benefits from a dexterous user. Untrained individuals use the statistics for a normal whip (though it will deal the new damage type). Other examples include a bladed throwing ring (shortsword with the thrown property), a three-section staff (quarterstaff with the reach property), or a flexible and strong spear (spear with the finesse property).\nNOTE! I&apos;ve included Spiked Chain as a sample, further weapons need to be added by you." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Proficient with Shadow Warrior weapon">
