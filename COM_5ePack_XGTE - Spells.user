When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects. \n\n A dispel magic cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell’s caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled. \n\n{b}Solid Fog.{/b} You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured.

These trees have the same statistics as an awakened tree, which appears in the Monster Manual, except they can’t speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don’t give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The grove guardians can’t leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible. \n\n{b}Additional Spell Effect.{/b} You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:\n- A constant {i}gust of wind{/i} in two locations of your choice \n- {i}Spike growth{/i} in one location of your choice \n- {i}Wind wall{/i} in two locations of your choice \n\nTo a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless." compset="Spell">

You choose the devil’s type, which must be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a barbed devil or a bearded devil. The devil appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. \n\nThe devil is unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master’s control and acts according to its nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature’s statistics. \n\nOn each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You make the check with advantage if you say the devil’s true name. If your check fails, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the devil carries out your command — such as “attack my enemies,” “explore the room ahead,” or “bear this message to the queen” — until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so. \n\nIf your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devil doesn’t disappear if it has become immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it disappears. \n\nIf you possess an individual devil’s talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no Charisma checks required. \n\n{b}At Higher Levels.{/b} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th." compset="Spell">

Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can’t enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll. \n\nIn addition, the sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the temple, and creatures within can’t be targeted by divination spells. \n\nFinally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to our Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point). \n\nThe temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple’s interior.
